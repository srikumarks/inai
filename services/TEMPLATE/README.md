# Inai service

A basic description of the service. You can use {{ref}} to capture the
reference using which this service is being instantiated. This will be
replaced when generating the documentation.

When copying this template for your service, you may want to eliminate the
code branches not relevant ot your usage environment. For example, if you
intend to use the service client side only, then you can eliminate the
server-side doc fetching branches. The branch is shown only for illustration.
